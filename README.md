Python Programming Challenges - Book 1

Work through the challenges in this book, in order.  If you get stuck, remember S.N.O.T.

Self     - Use every research resource you can think of: books, online, notes...
Neighbor - Ask the student next to you, maybe you can collaborate
Other    - Ask a 2nd year Student for some insight
Teacher  - If all the other steps failed, go Ask Mr. Schmidt. He will be happy to help with your 
           (by this point) tough, juicy problem!

After each problem, there is a section for you to fill out.  Put the answers in your source code as comments 
at the end of your program. DON'T print them out, just include them as comments.

Don't forget to use MEANINGFUL variable names. No more "blah", "why", and "fart"...... be professional!
